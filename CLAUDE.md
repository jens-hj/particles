- Use conventional commits
- Make sure to decompose into crates whenever it makes sense to do so
- Keep the main crate minimal without any logic. Always decompose into a separate crate documenting its purpose
- Whenever you've implemented something make sure to check it with `cargo check`
- Always keep in mind this should be as performant as possible. Make sure to use shaders for compute whenever it makes sense
- Let's always make sure not to invoke warnings. If it's something we're not using yet, let's just make it proper with _ or similar
- You can always read the current state of the project in README.md
- Make sure to keep the README.md up to date
- Always run `cargo run` before committing so I can inspect the result
- Remember to format the code using `cargo fmt`
- Always check diagnostics
- This project uses bun not npm or pnpm
- Remember to make use of the grep-mcp tool to look for known design patterns and good practices when implementing new features or refactoring existing ones.
- Always use ./plan/context.md to keep track of the current working state of the project, it should be updated very regularly, to be able to hand off the project to someone else or another AI.
- Keep all as much functionality in the main astra-gui crate, ONLY WGPU dependent things should be delegated to the astra-wgpu crate.
- Never try to fetch binary files or font files or other assets directly as they are too big, ask for them instead.
