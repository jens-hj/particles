- Use conventional commits
- Make sure to decompose into crates whenever it makes sense to do so
- Keep the main crate minimal without any logic. Always decompose into a separate crate documenting its purpose
- Whenever you've implemented something make sure to check it with cargo check
- Always keep in mind this should be as performant as possible. Make sure to use shaders for compute whenever it makes sense
- Let's always make sure not to invoke warnings. If it's something we're not using yet, let's just make it proper with _ or similar
